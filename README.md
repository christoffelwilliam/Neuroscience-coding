ðŸ§  Neuroscience Coding  

Welcome to my **Neuroscience Coding** repository! This is where I document my journey in learning to code for **neuroscience data analysis** and computational research.  

## ðŸš€ About This Repository  
As a **neuropharmacology researcher** wannabe, I have worked (once) with **ELISA** for protein measurement in the brain. Now, Iâ€™m learning Python to analyze neuroscience data more effectively and explore **computational neuroscience techniques**.  

## ðŸ”¬ What You'll Find Here  
This repository will include:  
âœ… **Data analysis scripts** (ELISA, behavioral studies)  
âœ… **Statistical analysis** (using NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas)  
âœ… **Data visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
âœ… **Exploratory neuroscience coding projects**  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries  
I am using:  
- **Python**, obviously (Jupyter Lab)  
- **NumPy, SciPy** (for data processing)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for visualization)  
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)  

## ðŸ“Œ Work in Progress  
This is a learning project, so expect improvements over time...

## ðŸ“¬ Contact  
Feel free to connect if youâ€™re interested in discussing neuroscience and coding! ðŸ˜Š or a constructive criticism or feedback would be nice!
